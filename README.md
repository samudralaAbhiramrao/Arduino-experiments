## About:

Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read **inputs** - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an **output** - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. To do so you use the Arduino programming language (based on Wiring), and the [Arduino Software IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software), based on Processing.

### Board Components:
1.Microcontroller-ATMega328p

2.USB port(Used to upload code to the Board)

3.Power jack(Used to give power Supply to the board)

4.16MHZ Crystal Oscillator (used to calculate the time for Micro controller)
